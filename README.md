# recipe-book-api

The api middleware for the recipe book app I have been developing. It serves
data from my local recipe book SQL Server database to the front end app I been
working on.

## Documentation (Swagger)

This API has been designed to conform with the OpenAPI 3.0 standard. The swagger
documentation page of the available routes for this API can be found at the
following route:

```
http://localhost:4444/swagger/
```

## Development

To get started with this API, the first step is to install all the required NPM
packages. This can be done by using either of the two NPM install commands:

```
npm i
npm install
```

NOTE: This requires node and npm to be installed. A Long Term Support (LTS)
version is recommend

The next stage is to set up your database. Eventually a DB setup SQL script will
be provided. In a .env file placed at the root of the application, set the
database connection string in a variable called DATABASE_URL. This is done in
the standard JDBC standard. Below shows the structure and an example. It requies
the following parameters:

- Server hostname or IP
- Server port
- Database name
- Username
- Password

```
DATABASE_URL="sqlserver://<server-ip-address>:<port>;database=<database-name>;user=<username>;password=<password>;encrypt=true;TrustServerCertificate=true;"

Example: DATABASE_URL="sqlserver://192.168.1.1:1433;database=Recipe Book;user=sa;password=password;encrypt=true;TrustServerCertificate=true;"
```

To ensure the database can be accessed using prisma run the first command below
to update the prisma schema, the second command allows this updated schema to be
provided by prisma client. If you make any changes to the database, you will
need to run both of these commands again.

```
npm run prisma-pull
npm run prisma-generate
```

### Testing

This API has been designed using Test Driven Development (TDD). Therefore, Jest
test coverage is high allowing for alteration tracking to be done using the
testing suite. An NPM command has been setup for this:

```
npm test
```

## Deployment

This API has been setup with Docker support from the outset. An image of this
app can be created using the docker build command as seen below. (insert-name
marks where you can set the Docker image name, the -t flag allows this name tag
to be allocated)

```
docker build . -t insert-name
```

To load this Docker image into a container, the docker run command is used as
follows with the name selected for the image in the previous step in place for
insert-name.

```
docker run -p 4444:4444 -d insert-name
```

NOTE: The Dockerfile has been configured to run on port 4444. The app can be run
on another port by replacing the first 4444 in the command above with your own
choice of port.
